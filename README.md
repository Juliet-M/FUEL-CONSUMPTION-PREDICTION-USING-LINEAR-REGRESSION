With increasing concerns about environmental sustainability and the impact of transportation on climate change, understanding the relationship between vehicle attributes and their environmental consequences is critical. The "Vehicle Attributes and Emissions Dataset," which includes detailed information about vehicles manufactured in the year 2000, offers an opportunity to analyze key factors such as engine size, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions. However, insights into how these attributes influence fuel efficiency and emissions across different vehicle types remain underexplored.
